# Disable-Christmas-Chests

A **client side** mod to disable the Christmas chests.

**_The mod does NOTHING when the date is not between the 24th and 26th of December (inclusive)_**

You can have the mod installed outside of the festive period, it will not affect your game at all. I do recommend unbinding the hotkey for it though.

If you do want to see how your world would look like with the chests on, the default keybind is `G` _(for Grinch)._ You can modify the button in the keybind settings.

### Missing a version?

Go to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/meza/Disable-Christmas-Chests/issues) and ask for a specific Minecraft version. I'm happy to make it.

### Why a mod?

During the festive period, Minecraft replaces the trapped chest and normal chest textures to the exact same texture. This means that when the [Remove Christmas Chests Resource Pack](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/remove-christmas-chests/) then overrides the Christmast textures, it gets applied to both chest variants making them indistinguishable from each other.
